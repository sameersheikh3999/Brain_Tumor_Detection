# Brain_Tumor_Detection
In the Brain Tumor Classification project, our primary goal was to develop a robust machine learning model capable of accurately classifying brain tumors from medical imaging data, such as MRI scans. This project aimed to assist medical professionals in diagnosing brain tumors swiftly and accurately, ultimately improving patient care.
